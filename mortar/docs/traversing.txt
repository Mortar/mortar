Traversing Content

  This document covers what happens when you traverse content by
  getting a piece of content. The behaviour described below applies
  equally to content obtained by a search, retrieving by id and
  retrieving by reference.

  ISecurity

  IRegistrations

  Both only apply to the traversal context of the current content
  object:

  >>> from mortar import get
  >>> get('root')['someobjwithsecuritychanges']['someobjwithregistrations'].view()
  >>> get('someotherroot')['someobjwithsecuritychanges']['someobjwithregistrations'].view()

  (the views should be different)
