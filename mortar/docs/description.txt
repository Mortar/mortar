Mortar
======

Mortar will be an environment that insulates the application developer
from the implementation details of storage, retrieval and searching of
content. 

This will allow applications to be developed in one environment, say
on a simple local Python+SQLite setup, and then deploy to another
environment, say Google App Engine or a clustered array of Amazon EC2
instances, with no changes to application code.

This architecture should also provide a seamless environment for
application developers to work with a disparate array of data sources.

A secondary aim is to allow DBAs and system administrators to optimise
the performance of applications without modifying any application
code.

However, for now, it is in the very early stages of development and
should probably be avoided unless you simply want to see how it's
shaping up or you want to actively participate in development.
